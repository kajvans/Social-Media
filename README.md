# Social-media platform
This is a hobby project of mine practicing my javascript, HTML, and PHP skills.
I am practicing these skills by creating a text-based social media platform.

On this platform, you can create an account and start posting text-based messages. 
you can like dislike and comment on each post. 
you can follow your favorite users so you see their posts first.
the post you see is sorted on post date so you see the newer posts first and then the older ones. sadly there is no recommended section for every person because I do not have the skills at the moment for something like that but I will try it later on in the project.

at the moment the project is far from finished.

if you see something that could be done better go ahead and push a commit to the repository.


i will be picking up to project again but will reform it to use node.js and angular because it is easier to use an will look a lot cleaner than how to now is. So the PHP language will not be used anymore but there will be far more javascript now to replace all the PHP. It will be created with express.js for the backend and angular for frontend. for database i will still use sql because it is easy to use and relations are nice to have for a social media platform to link data easier with eachother
