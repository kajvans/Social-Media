# Social-media platform
This is a hobby project of mine practicing my javascript, HTML, and PHP skills.
I am practicing these skills by creating a text-based social media platform.

On this platform, you can create an account and start posting text-based messages. 
you can like dislike and comment on each post. 
you can follow your favorite users so you see their posts first.
the post you see is sorted on post date so you see the newer posts first and then the older ones. sadly there is no recommended section for every person because I do not have the skills at the moment for something like that but I will try it later on in the project.

at the moment the project is far from finished.
